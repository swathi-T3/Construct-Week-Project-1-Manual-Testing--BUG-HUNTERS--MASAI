## 💬 Final Note

> This being my first testing project, I learned how to structure manual testing in a layered, organized fashion. From planning, writing cases, exploring features, and documenting bugs, I tried to apply a real-world QA process. Special thanks to my mentor for helping clarify exploratory issues and guiding test design in a professional way.
